# METAPAC Validation Study

Code repository for the manuscript "Validation of a plasma multi-metabolite signature for the exclusion of pancreatic cancer in subjects at-risk"

## Study Overview

This repository contains the analysis codes used in the METAPAC study, a prospective, multicenter, investigator-blinded phase IV trial (EDRN) that validated plasma-based metabolic signatures for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) detection.

### Study Registration
- German Clinical Trials Register ID: DRKS00010866

## Abstract

### Background
Two plasma-based metabolic signatures, including CA19.9, were developed to exclude pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in cohorts with an increased annual risk, aiming for earlier diagnosis to improve overall survival in a devastating difficult-to-diagnose and difficult-to-treat cancer.

### Methods
- **Study Design**: Prospective, multicenter, investigator blinded, enrichment design, phase IV trial
- **Participants**: 1370 patients with undefined pancreatic lesions
- **Centers**: 23 German centers
- **Follow-up**: 24 months
- **Analysis**: Targeted quantitative plasma metabolite analysis using LC-MS/MS platform

### Key Findings
- **i-Metabolic signature** (12 analytes + CA19.9):
  - Specificity: 0.917 (95%CI 0.912-0.922)
  - Compared to CA19.9 alone: 0.483 (95%CI 0.476-0.491)

- **m-Metabolic signature** (4 analytes + CA19.9):
  - Specificity: 0.935 (95%CI 0.931-0.940)
  - Significant discrimination in NOD cohort (p = 0.038)

### Interpretation
The validated signatures showed significant improvement over CA19.9 alone and maintained consistent performance across PDAC prevalence rates of 1-20%. The signatures are ready for clinical implementation in patients with a 1% annual PDAC risk.
